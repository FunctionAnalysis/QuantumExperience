# QuantumExperience
This repository contains the QASM assembly language for the IBM quantum processor hosted at:

https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/

The focus of this repository is on implementations of Grover's search algorithm, specifically those implementations relating to searches for unknown numbers of solutions.

Current forms of the code must have all comments removed before importing to the IBM q-processor.  File formats which may be imported using the IBM are specifically those files with the extension "foo.qasm"

Versions of IBM's QASM editor will be listed at the beginning of each file.
